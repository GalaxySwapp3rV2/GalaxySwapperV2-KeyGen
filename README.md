### GalaxySwapperV2 auto key-gen. 

1. A quick note, the owner will probably get mad at this and possibly will either change how the keygen works entirely or will result in ratting/spreading other forms of trojans/malware via the swapper as he'd be making no money and would be triggered, use the swapper at your own risk. This will be abused by others!

### How to use?

1. Put `gen.py` onto your Desktop and than ensure you have python3 installed (you can install it via the microsoft store) 
2. Run pip3 install requests - Do this via cmd (windows key -> cmd.exe) - This will install the requests module
3. Run auto_gen.bat and you'll have your key, these expire every three days but are helpful as you do not need to go through the ADs.

### Lastly, if you're thinking of skidding this, don't bother. It's 49 lines of code, learn to code.
