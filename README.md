### GalaxySwapperV2 auto key-gen. 

1. A quick note, the owner will probably get mad at this and possibly will either change how the keygen works entirely or will result in ratting/spreading other forms of trojans/malware via the swapper as he'd be making no money and would be triggered, use the swapper at your own risk. This will be abused by others!
2. The binary is for those who do not want to spend time downloading off of the website (involves going through AD's, for those who already have the application, just move to the next step.

### How to use?

> <a href=https://youtu.be/qB0fODNMi08>YouTube Video</a>
1. Put `gen.py` onto your Desktop and than ensure you have python3 installed (you can install it via the microsoft store) 
2. Run pip3 install requests - Do this via cmd (windows key -> cmd.exe) - This will install the requests module
3. Run auto_gen.bat and you'll have your key, these expire every three days but are helpful as you do not need to go through the ADs.

### Lastly, if you're thinking of skidding this, don't bother. It's 49 lines of code, learn to code.
